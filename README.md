# Snake Game in Python

This is a classic Snake Game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics module. The game allows players to control a snake using the keyboard to collect food, grow in size, and increase their score while avoiding collisions with the screen borders and the snake's own body.

# Features

Simple Gameplay: Navigate the snake to eat the red food and avoid collisions.
Score Tracking: The game keeps track of your current score and the highest score.
Speed Increase: As the snake eats more food, the speed of the game gradually increases.
Keyboard Controls: Control the snake using either the WASD keys or the arrow keys.

# Controls

W or Up Arrow: Move Up
S or Down Arrow: Move Down
A or Left Arrow: Move Left
D or Right Arrow: Move Right

# How to Run the Game

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from Python.org.
Install the Turtle graphics module if you haven't already (it's usually included with Python).

# Game Rules

Use the controls to move the snake and collect food.
Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, and your score increases by 10 points.
Avoid hitting the screen borders or the snake's own body; otherwise, the game will reset, and your current score will be lost.
The game speed increases as you collect more food, making it more challenging.

# Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language used
Turtle Module: Used for creating the game's graphics

# Future Improvements

Adding sound effects and background music
Implementing different game levels or difficulty settings
Adding more obstacles to make the game challenging
Improving the game's visual design and animations
